ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* README.md
* build.sh
* java\
* java\src\
* java\src\com\
* java\src\com\zeerd\
* java\src\com\zeerd\dltviewer\
* java\src\com\zeerd\dltviewer\ControlActivity.java
* java\src\com\zeerd\dltviewer\HelpActivity.java
* java\src\com\zeerd\dltviewer\LogRow.java
* java\src\com\zeerd\dltviewer\LogTableAdapter.java
* java\src\com\zeerd\dltviewer\MainActivity.java
* java\src\com\zeerd\dltviewer\SearchActivity.java
* java\src\com\zeerd\dltviewer\SettingActivity.java

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* jni\ => app\src\main\jni\
* res\ => app\src\main\res\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
